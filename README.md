# Healthcare Premium Prediction
A Machine Learning Project to Predict the Health Insurance Premium Cost using Regression Models.

### Objective: 
- Develop a high-accuracy (>97%) predictive model. The percentage difference between the predicted and actual value on a minimum of 95% of the errors should be less than 
10%. 
- Deploy the model in the cloud so that an insurance underwriter can run it from anywhere. 
- Create an interactive Streamlit application that an underwriter can use for predictions.
